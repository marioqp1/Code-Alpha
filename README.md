Added main program logic for hotel reservation system

This commit includes the main logic for the hotel reservation system in Java. The program allows users to check available rooms, view room categories and details, and make room reservations based on budget and room type. It also provides options to view all rooms and their details. The program uses a RoomManager class to manage room data and operations, and it integrates user input using a Scanner object.

The program structure includes a main menu with options to navigate through different functionalities. User interactions are handled through input prompts and method calls to the RoomManager class for data processing and room reservation.

This commit prepares the codebase for further development and testing of the hotel reservation system functionality.
